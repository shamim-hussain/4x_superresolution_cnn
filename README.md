# 4x Super-resolution by CNN
Investigation in 4x Super-resolution by Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. The network designs are my own and they work in the RGB color space. The concepts are taken from the papers in the "Papers" directory.

Data: [Saved at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/snirjhar/superresolution-dataset-5k](https://www.kaggle.com/snirjhar/superresolution-dataset-5k)

Investigations regarding 3 major factors are carried out.
* Incremental upsampling
* Perceptual Loss
* Sup-pixel convolution

For results and more info see the Powerpoint Presentation.
